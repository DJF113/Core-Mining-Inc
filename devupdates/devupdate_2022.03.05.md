Well, I finally have this plugin hosted on GitHub! Of course, if you're reading this, you've probably already noticed! I'm now working on figuring out all of the shiny new features GitHub offers to creators, and learning how to integrate it with my workflow. I'm currently using a separate repository to back up my continuous branch every evening, so hopefully there will be no more mishaps with overwritten files. The CMI plugin is now also listed on the list of plugins that are available through [ESLauncher2](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/ESLauncher2), so if I understand everything correctly, it'll keep things up to date automatically.

In news on the plugin itself, version 0.1.7 ends with tensions building with the Syndicate Extremists. I originally had that entire arc outlined and ready to go, but after scripting about 1/3 of the missions that were planned, I came up with an idea to flesh out that particular story some more. So I'm now working on writing the basic outlines for the updated arc. It shouldn't change anything with the missions in the current version, so there should be no need to start a new pilot if you started one on the [0.1.7+](https://github.com/DJF113/Core-Mining-Inc/releases/tag/v0.1.7) GitHub version. Everything is flowing fairly well right now, so hopefully I can get the new missions scripted fairly easily, and get a new update out at some point.

Thanks for reading!
