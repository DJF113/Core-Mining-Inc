# Development Information
I've decided to discontinue my use of GitHub due to their AI policies, so I'm no longer going to be updating this project here. I've deleted most of my private repos and personal coding projects, but I decided to leave this one up in case anyone is interested.

As I can find time I'm still working on this project, so what is here could be considered a demo of what I hope to have completed sometime in the future. When I have it closer to completion I do plan to release everything.

# Core Mining, Inc.
The Core Mining, Inc. mod adds a storyline that offers you the chance to work for a newly
started company by the same name. You start with them from the very beginning and help build
up the company. Along the way, you can make different choices which may impact the game at a
later time, as well as potentially make major changes to the plotline. Not everything is in
place yet, but I'm hoping to make a plugin that fits in seamlessly with the vanilla game.
There is a major alternate story that goes with the main one that still needs to be written
and I also would like input on the difficulty of the missions as well as typos and glitches
in the mod. Any other suggestions on the overall flow and quality of the mod are appreciated
as well.
